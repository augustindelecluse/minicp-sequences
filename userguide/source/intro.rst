This document is made for anyone who wants to learn
constraint programming using using Mini-CP as a support.

This tutorial will continuously evolve.
Don't hesitate to give us feedback or suggestion for improvement.
You are also welcome to report any mistake or bug.


What is Mini-CP
===============
The success the MiniSAT solver has largely contributed to the dissemination of (CDCL) SAT solvers.
The MiniSAT solver has a neat and minimalist architecture that is well documented.
We believe the CP community is currently missing such a solver that would permit new-comers to demystify the internals of CP technology. 
We introduce Mini-CP a white-box bottom-up teaching framework for CP implemented in Java. 
Mini-CP is voluntarily missing many features that you would find in a commercial or complete open-source solver. 
The implementation, although inspired by state-of-the-art solvers is not focused on efficiency but rather on readability to convey the concepts as clearly as possible.
Mini-CP is small and well tested.

Mini-CP source-code is available from bitbucket_.

**Using an IDE**

We recommend using IntelliJ_ or Eclipse_.

From IntelliJ_ you can simply import the project.

.. code-block:: none

    Open > (select pom.xml in the minicp directory and open as new project)


From Eclipse_ you can simply import the project.

.. code-block:: none

    Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects (select minicp directory)


**From the command line**

Using maven_ command line you can do you can do:


.. code-block:: none

    $mvn compile # compile all the project
    $mvn test    # run all the test suite

Some other useful commands

.. code-block:: none

    $mvn checkstyle:checktyle   # generates a report in target/site/checkstyle.html
    $mvn findbugs:gui           # opens a gui with potential source of bugs in your code
    $mvn jacoco:report          # creates a cover report in target/site/jacoco/index.html
    $mvn javadoc:javadoc        # creates javadoc in target/site/apidocs/index.html
