This document is made for anyone who wants to learn
constraint programming using using mini-cp as a support.

This tutorial will continuously evolve.
Don't hesitate to give us feedback or suggestion for improvement.
You are also welcome to report any mistake or bug.


What is mini-cp
=======================================
The success minisat solver has largely contributed to the dissemination of (CDCL) SAT solvers. 
Minisat has a neat and minimalist architecture that is well documented. 
We believe the CP community is currently missing such a solver that would permit new-comers to demystify the internals of CP technology. 
We introduce Mini-CP a white-box bottom-up teaching framework for CP implemented in Java. 
Mini-CP is voluntarily missing many features that you would find in a commercial or complete open-source solver. 
The implementation, although inspired by state-of-the-art solvers is not focused on efficiency but rather on readability to convey the concepts as clearly as possible.
Mini-CP is small (<1500 LOC excluding tests) and well tested.

 
Install mini-cp
=======================================

Minicp is available from bitbucket_.
The `Javavadoc API <_static/index.html>`_.

**Using an IDE**

We recommend using IntelliJ_ or Eclipse_.

From IntelliJ_ you can simply import the project.

.. code-block:: none

    Open > (select pom.xml in the minicp directory)


From Eclipse_ you can simply import the project.

.. code-block:: none

    Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects (select minicp directory)


**From the command line**

Using maven_ command line you can do you can do:


.. code-block:: none

    $mvn compile
    $mvn test
