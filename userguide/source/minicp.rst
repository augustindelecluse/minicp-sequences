The complete architecture of mini-cp is described this `document <_static/mini-cp.pdf>`_.
Some slides with animations about mini-cp internals `slides <http://tinyurl.com/y8n4knhx>`_.

From a state and inference prospective, specific outcomes include:

* Trailing and state reversion
* Domain and variable implementation â€“ Propagation queue
* Arithmetic Constraints
* Logical Constraints
* Reified Constraints
* Global Constraints
* Views


While, from a search prospective, the outcomes include:

* Backtracking algorithms and depth first search
* Branch and Bound for Constraint Optimization
* Incremental Computation
* Variable and Value Heuristics implementation
* Searching with phases
* Large Neighborhood Search
